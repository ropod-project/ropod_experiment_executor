# ropod_experiment_executor

A ROS package for modelling and executing robot experiments. Each experiment is modelled as a state machine; the definition and execution of state machine reuses most of the functionalities in [`mas_execution_manager`](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_execution_manager).
